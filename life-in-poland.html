           <em>'Where your treasure is, your heart will be there too.'</em>
           <br/>
           Fryderyk Chopin 
         </p>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>Poland – a country which resides on what was formerly known as Eastern Europe – is a country
        whose tourist star is dramatically rising.</p>
        <p>A place which has long been steeped in tradition and history, it’s also a land of a land of considerable
          natural beauty with whose idyllic lakes, beaches and mountains which are perfectly juxtaposed to
          the cultural rigours of the historic cities.</p>
          <p>It has a very rich culture especially with its historical churches and museums. Poland, a country that
            has seen hundreds of wars throughout its history, completely erased from the map, and has
            undergone various resistances, has overcome all these difficulties and has been able to bring its
            values to this day.</p>
            <p>However, stability and economy of the country are almost not affected by some crises happening
              around the world. Therefore, it receives serious investments, especially from other countries of
              Europe.</p>
              <p>Poland’s education market has been the most dynamically developing one in Europe during the last
                twelve years. The number of higher education institutions has increased five fold while the number
                of students quadrupled. Each year almost half a million young people begin their education at
                universities and colleges.</p>
                <p>Polish academic traditions reach back to 14th century, some of the Europe's oldest universities can
                  be found here. The Jagiellonian University of Cracow was established in 1364. Nicholas Copernicus
                  and Marie Skłodowska-Curie are among great names of Polish scientists known and admired
                  worldwide.</p>
                  <p>
                    Polish universities offer high quality studies and are an integral part of the European education
space. All leading universities offer programs thought in English, these include medicine,
engineering, humanities, business and finance. Poland takes active part in the Bolonia Process.
Thanks to the ECTS (European Credit Transfer System) students can be fully mobile, and continue
education in other countries.

                <h3>Place of our activity is Wrocław</h3>
                <p style="align-content: space-around; text-align: justify;">
                <p>It lies on the banks of the River Oder in the Silesian Lowlands of Central Europe, roughly 350 kilometres from the Baltic Sea to the north and 40 kilometres from the Sudeten Mountains to the south. The official population of Wrocław in 2019 was 642,869, with a further 1.25 million residing in the metropolitan area.
                  Wrocław is a university city with a student population of over 130,000, making it arguably one of the most youth-oriented cities in the country. Since the beginning of the 20th century, the University of Wrocław, previously Breslau University, has produced 9 Nobel Prize laureates and is renowned for its high quality of teaching.</p>
                  <p>Wrocław is classified as a Gamma- global city by GaWC. It was placed among the top 100 cities in the world for the Mercer Quality of Living Survey and in the top 100 of the smartest cities in the world in the IESE Cities in Motion Index 2017 and 2019 report.</p>
                  <p>Wrocław also possesses numerous historical landmarks, including the Main Market Square, Cathedral Island and the Centennial Hall, which is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
                    In 1989, 1995 and 2019 Wrocław hosted the European Youth Meetings of the Taizé Community and hosted the Eucharistic Congress in 1997 and the 2012 European Football Championship. In 2016, the city was a European Capital of Culture and the World Book Capital. Also in that year, Wrocław hosted the Theatre Olympics, World Bridge Gamesand the European Film Awards.

                  <br />
                    Moreover we have much more interesting places to visit, such as : Warsaw, Gdansk, Poznan, Gdansk, Torun or Zakopane.</p>

                  <h3>We are part of the nature !</h3>
                  <p style="align-content: space-around; text-align: justify;">
                  <p>Nature plays a significant role in the Polish life. We are proud of our nature and we would like our guests to enjoy it as well. Feel free to discover the treasures of Polish nature!
                    You certainly do not associate Poland with deserts, do you? Well, don't be surprised to encounter such extraordinary natural environments in this country! A two hour drive from the airport of Gdańsk one can easily find wandering sand dunes. Near the summer resort of Łeba you'll get a chance to feel a little bit like in Africa - however the temperatures are definitely much more friendly.
                    The Polish coast consists almost entirely of sand. Are you a beach lover? Do not miss the unique Hel Peninsula - a long and small bit of land and a summer paradise at the same time. However Hel has got much more to offer: It is paradise for Kite and windsurfers, conditions are unique ! If you aren't into sports, you can also find a seal aquarium, several military objects from WWII and a lighthouse.
                    The North-eastern part of Poland is well known for its lakes. The Great Masurian Lakes offer you countless tranquil spots where you'll easily regain your balance and get a chance to admire the beauty of nature.  Poland's largest lake, Śniardwy, is located here - as well as other pearls such as Jeziorak, Łuknajno and Hańcza.
                    Fancy a visit at an unusual garden? Who doesn't! We'd like to recommend the unique theme garden Hortulus. Several different gardens in the same place are available for visitors: Japanese garden, French garden, Mediterranean garden, water garden, stone garden, aroma garden, colour garden. 
                    It's impossible to talk about Polish nature and miss the spectacular primeval forest of Białowieża and its mighty inhabitants - the wisents. There is scarcely a better place to witness the forest that originally covered vast areas of Europe. Even in the major Polish cities you are able to get in touch with nature. In the very heart of Wrocław you will find lots of parks and theme gardens in a middle of a city such as Japanese Garden, or Botanical Garden
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>Nature can sometimes be featured on the UNESCO world heritage list. An example? The Hala Stulecia. How about a visit to the underground world? Don't miss the exciting Jaskinia Raj (Paradise cave) in the Świętokrzyskie mountains or Jaskinia Niedźwiedzia (Bear Cave) . Its extraordinary stalactites seem to come from a fairy tale.
                    Plateau mountains? Yes, we've got them as well here in Poland. The Stołowe mountains are covered with luscious forests and the local birdlife attracts many birdwatchers. But the key factor is the stunning views!
                    When people in Poland say 'mountains', they usually mean the unique Tatra mountains. Located just south of Cracow, near the ski resort Zakopane, the Tatra mountains are astonishing with their character and the fantastic views. Do not miss the Morskie Oko - a lake hidden amongst the mountain tops!
                    A different type of Polish mountains are the Bieszczady-mountains, often referred to as Poland's wildest mountain range. The relatively low Bieszczady are perfect for hikers longing for wild nature. If you'd like to take a glimpse at wolves and bears and if you don't need wifi or spa to be lucky - Bieszczady's the place to be!In Poland we use to say “ Quit everything and visit  Bieszczady”
                    Are you still thinking that Poland is grey, boring and polluted? We hope we managed to convince you that this country really is worth paying a visit. See you in Poland!
                    Weather is table - summer is summer, winter is winter. There’s a big distinction between seasons which makes life more interesting. We have fresh scented air in spring, scorching hot in summer, colourful leaves in autumn and snow in winter.

                  <p style="align-content: space-around; text-align: justify;">
                  <p>Is it hard to learn Polish for you ?</p><br/>
                    <p>No matter how hard you tried, you just weren’t ever sure exactly what you were doing or why you
                      were doing it ! 
                  </p>
                  <p>The Polish language is beautiful, but it is also one of the most difficult languages of the world. If you
                    want to study Polish, you need to apply a dose of patience. Moreover, apart from many linguistic
                    traps related to the multiple usages of specific common words, the pronunciation may bring you
                    immense frustration.</p>
                    <p>English is fairly widely spoken in Poland with just over a third of Poles overall reported as being able
                      to speak English to some degree. This ratio goes up in the major cities and tourist destinations,
                      where you will have no problems finding people who can speak English if you need help</p>

                  <h3>Work life in Poland</h3>
                  <p style="align-content: space-around; text-align: justify;">
                    <p>It’s not easy to work and study at the same time, but it can be done, especially if you’ve chosen
                      evening or weekend courses. Nevertheless, think carefully about whether this is in your best
                      interest, as it may affect your academic performance. Most universities have academic career
                      centres, where you can find information about jobs, internships and trainings. You can also find job
                      offers at the nearest labour office.</p>
                      <p>It may not be so good in every part of the country, but in the southern west, in the Lower Silesia
                        region, unemployment is very low and you can choose between many different companies. Big or
                        small, production or services, Polish or foreign – the choice is yours. They say that wages in Poland
                        are low, but the cost of living also isn’t very high (at least not as high as in Western cities).</p>
                        <p>Majority of all people living in Poland (about 60%) have settled in the country’s urban areas. There
                          are quite a few bigger towns in Poland, with life in Poland focusing on five of them, which qualify as
                          major cities. Warsaw, the country’s capital, alone has about 1.7 million inhabitants. Most inhabitants
                          are of a Polish descent. In fact, there is only a small minority of Germans, Ukrainians, Slovaks,
                          Lithuanians, and Belarusians.</p>

                  <p style="align-content: space-around; text-align: justify;">
                  <p>Highways provide from eastern lakes to western forests and from mountainy south to the northern
                    seaports.</p>
                    <p>All of main economic regions, well known tourist attractions and main airports are perfectly
                      connected. Cities offer all the services and entertainment one needs, but visiting in the village is also
                      good idea for a roundtrip!</p>
                      <p>You can find things to do and visit all over Poland. Besides, our traffic jams are nothing compared to
                        those in Western Europe. Also Poland is really safety - no earthquakes, no tornadoes or hurricanes,
                        no volcanoes, no tsunamis, no drifting ice mountains. The only problem you will have in Poland is if
                        you just eat a lot of Pierogi!!</p>

        <p style="align-content: space-around; text-align: justify;">
          <p>Wroclaw is a leading economic, technology and cultural center of Poland, and also one of the most rapidly growing metropolitan areas. The city is known for its strong business focus: not only numerous big Polish companies were created here, but also foreign investors find Wroclaw to be one of the best investment locations in Europe.</p>
          <p>Wroclaw – European Capital of Culture 2016 – is a fantastic place to live in, with hundreds
            of restaurants and thousands of film shows and theatre performances. It also provides high
            quality health infrastructure and most dynamic growth of housing supply in Poland</p>
            <p>The passion for knowledge and growth fuel creativity in the city. IT, biotechnology,
              engineering, chemistry and pharmaceuticals are the industries strongly represented in
              Wroclaw both by locally born start-ups and global leaders</p>

              <p><strong>Not at all !</strong><br/>
                Beautiful Old Town, the variety of architecture, numerous green spaces, amazing food and cafe scene and lots of cool spots – Wroclaw has it all!</p>
                <p>Wroclaw has one of the most beautiful market squares in Poland, and I even dare to say in Europe.</p>
                <p>The medieval Market Square is now a pedestrian zone and the heart of the city. Around the square, you can admire numerous colourful houses, one prettier than another.</p>
                <p>Some of them still hold their historical names, associated with their exterior details or the function. You can find here house under the golden jug, under the golden eagle, under the golden star, under the black eagle and many more.
