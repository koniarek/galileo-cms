          <p>The diploma from a European country renders qualifications and programmes of study more easily
            comparable for students between countries across Europe. Many universities in Poland, the
            Entrepreneurship Academy, which was established to help students who envision starting their own
            businesses, provides students with free enterprise advice, seminars and office space services.</p>
        <p>Today, Poland is becoming an increasingly popular study destination, with about 72,000 international
          students choosing to study there in 2017/18.
          Foreigners who have graduated from any Polish university undergraduate and associate degree can
          apply for a temporary residence permit.</p>

a job in Poland or planning to establish economic activity in these lands.

                  <p>The Wrocław University of Science and Technology was founded in 1945, mainly as a result of the

                          <p>Higher education in Poland is free for Polish citizens. If you wish to benefit from this as well, you will need to sit the same entrance exams as Polish students and study a course taught in the Polish language. Otherwise, international students are required to pay tuition fees, which are typically in the range of US$2,230-4,180 per year at public universities in Poland. Fees at private universities in Poland will be slightly higher; depending on your course and the institution, the fees could be up to US$6,600 a year. Universities in Poland have recently stopped charging these fees in full up-front, in order to ensure that fees do not present too much of a barrier for international students.
                            Note that there are relatively few scholarships available for foreign students, so it’s likely that you’ll need to cover your own costs. However, it may be worth checking with the universities to which you are applying, to see whether any funding opportunities are available.

                                <p>Costs of living in Poland are relatively low, though the amount of money you need will vary depending on your lifestyle and the city you’re based in. You will probably need at least 2,500 PLN (~US$650) per month to cover living costs, including accommodation. Accommodation in student halls of residence is usually cheaper at around 250-340 PLN (~US$60-90) per month for a shared room, and between 430-640 PLN (~US$110-160) for a single room. Alternatively, a shared rented flat could cost around 640 to 850 PLN (~US$160-220) per month, whereas a very small one-room single apartment could start from around 1,280 PLN (~US$330).  
                                  Health insurance is compulsory for all students for the entire length of their stay in Poland. Students from the EU are eligible for free or discounted health care if they can present a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC), while it’s recommended that non-EU students buy health insurance either before or as soon as possible after their arrival in Poland.
